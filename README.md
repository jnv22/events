# Events

This is a project that will allow users to lookup events, using the EventBright API, and monitor the forecasted weather 
using the OpenWeatherMap API, during the duration of an event.  Due to the limitations from the OpenWeatherMap API,
users will be encouraged to select events less than 6 days out due to the API's 5 day/3hour forecasts.
Utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Jquery, users will be making AJAX calls to both APIs, returning JSONP data back.
